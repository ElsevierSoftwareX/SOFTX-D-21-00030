ParSD - Tool to design and analyze particle size distributions

Many material products consist of initial raw materials of different particle sizes. The
main functions of the software ParSD are (1) to design mixes (batches) from a set of
raw materials of different particle sizes according to defined particle size distribution
models, (2) to compare a raw material batch with a specified particle size distribution
model in terms of the particle sizes and (3) to calculate parameters of specified models
from a defined raw material batch. Besides the possibility for the user to define an own
model, the pre-defined models comprise the models by Andreasen and Dinger /Funk
amongst others.
