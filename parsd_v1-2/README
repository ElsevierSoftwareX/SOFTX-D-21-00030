2. Installation notes

Go to subfolder 'Install' and run the starter corresponding to your operating system ('Linux-Starter', 'macOS-Starter.command' or 'Windows-Starter.bat'). For GNU/Linux operating system and macOS, basically, a shell-script is copied to the folder above (./..). In the shell-script, 'Rscript main.R' is executed to startup the application. For windows, the batch-script asks for the Rscript.exe-file, which is in your installation folder of R, possibly in the 'bin' subfolder. After selecting Rscript.exe, a batch-script including the path to Rscript.exe and calling main.R is created in the folder above (.\..).

To start the application, run 'ParSD' on GNU/Linux operating system, 'ParSD.command' on macOS and on Windows 'ParSD.vbs'. With these starters, on GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, the terminal is invisible. 

Note: It is possible that you are asked if you really want to execute the file/s or mark them as executable. To run the application, it should be marked as executable.
