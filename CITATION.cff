    "Many material products consist of initial raw materials of different particle sizes. The main functions of the software ParSD are (1) to design mixes (batches) from a set of raw materials of different particle sizes according to defined particle size distribution models, (2) to compare a raw material batch with a specified particle size distribution model in terms of the particle sizes and (3) to calculate parameters of specified models from a defined raw material batch. Besides the possibility for the user to define an own model, the pre-defined models comprise the models by Andreasen and Dinger/Funk amongst others.
